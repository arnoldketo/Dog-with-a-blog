    <h1> DOG WITH A BLOG </h1>
    <h2> Hello everyone welcome to my blog! </h2>
    <p> So basically I am a <em> Talking Dog </em> !. I spend my day on my computer watching cat videos and old youtube videos.</p>
    <p> I come from a nice loving family. They picked me off the streets and made me one of their own. I do not know what I"d do without them</p>
