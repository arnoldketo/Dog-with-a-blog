    <h1> DOG WITH A BLOG </h1>
    <h2> Hello everyone welcome to my blog! </h2>
    <p> So basically I am a <em> Talking Dog </em> !. I spend my day on my computer watching cat videos and old youtube videos.</p>
    <p> I come from a nice loving family. They picked me off the streets and made me one of their own. I do not know what I"d do without them</p>

    <p> I'd love to show you all a picture of my family but that is too much work for me darling, I can't take all that!</p>
    <p> Oh wait, Its your lucky day. I think I have one.</p>

    <p> Lately, I have been quite sad and lonely. I think I've reached the stage where I need someone to fill the void.</p>
    <p> So, there is this hot girl I've been looking out for, she's called<em> Francesca</em>. She's the most beautiful thing I've seen in this world</p>
